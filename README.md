## Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹

"The technology is my passion", "I love to develop" and things like these can be said by anyone. But just few of them are really going deeper into a technology, to understand really how it does work.

This is how I am: analysing the requirements, searching the best technology to achieve the objective, studying and finally implementing a high-quality solution. In my philosophy these steps are all equally important.
